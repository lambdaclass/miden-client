# DAP Debugging

The Miden client supports interactive debugging via the [Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/). You can debug both raw Miden Assembly scripts and Rust programs compiled to Miden via `midenc`. This lets you step through execution, set breakpoints, and inspect stack/memory state using any DAP-compatible client (e.g. VS Code, the `miden-debug` TUI).

## Feature flags

Two feature flags control debugging support:

| Feature | Crate | What it enables |
| ------- | ----- | --------------- |
| `dap` | `miden-client`, `miden-client-cli` | Compiles in DAP support (`execute_program_with_dap`, `--start-debug-adapter` CLI flag). |
| `testing` | `miden-client-cli` | Enables test-only CLI helpers such as offline account creation. Not available in production builds. |

### Building with features

```bash
# Build the CLI with DAP support
cargo build -p miden-client-cli --features dap

# Build with DAP and test-only offline helpers
cargo build -p miden-client-cli --features dap,testing

# Build without DAP
cargo build -p miden-client-cli
```

Include the `dap` feature to use `--start-debug-adapter`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create an account

With a running node:

```bash
miden-client init
miden-client new-wallet
miden-client sync
```

Or without a node (requires `testing` feature):

```bash
miden-client init
miden-client new-wallet --offline
```

### 2. Write a test script

Create a file `test_debug.masm`:

```
@transaction_script
pub proc main
  push.1.2
  add
  push.3
  mul
  push.9
  assert_eq
end
```

### 3. Start the DAP server

```bash
miden-client exec \
  --script-path test_debug.masm \
  --start-debug-adapter 127.0.0.1:4711
```

The client will compile the script, start a debug adapter server, and wait for a DAP client to
connect before executing.

### 4. Connect a debugger

In a separate terminal, connect the `miden-debug` TUI:

```bash
miden-debug --dap-connect 127.0.0.1:4711
```

You can now step through execution, inspect the stack, and set breakpoints.


## How it works

When `--start-debug-adapter` is passed:

1. The client compiles the transaction script from its filesystem path so source locations point at
   the real file.
2. The transaction executor runs with the DAP program executor, which binds a TCP listener on the
   specified address and waits for a DAP client connection.
3. Once connected, the DAP client controls execution: continue, step, breakpoints, and state
   inspection.
4. If the DAP client requests a restart, the client refreshes the cached source file, recompiles the
   script from disk, and starts a new debug session.

## Extracting recorded advice mutations

During a DAP session the advice mutations produced by the transaction host's event handlers are
recorded, one entry per `on_event` invocation. This log is what an event-replay debug session
needs to re-execute the same transaction without the live transaction host.

The DAP program executor is created and consumed inside the transaction executor, so the log is
read through a shared handle obtained from the `DapConfig` before execution:

```rust,ignore
let mut config = miden_debug::DapConfig::new("127.0.0.1:4711");
let recorder = config.record_event_mutations();
miden_debug::DapConfig::set_global(config);

client
    .execute_program_with_dap(account_id, tx_script, advice_inputs, foreign_accounts)
    .await?;

// One `Vec<AdviceMutation>` per event handler invocation, in execution order,
// describing the final run of the session (restarts reset the log).
let recorded = recorder.take();
```

The CLI does this automatically and reports the number of recorded mutation sets when the
session ends.

## Recording a session for offline replay

Pass `--record <FILE>` alongside `--start-debug-adapter` to write a self-contained *replay
snapshot* of the session once it ends:

```bash
miden-client exec \
  --script-path test_debug.masm \
  --start-debug-adapter 127.0.0.1:4711 \
  --record session.mdsnap
```

The snapshot captures the program, its stack and advice inputs, the MAST forests the transaction
host resolved (account code, note scripts, ...), and the recorded event log — everything needed to
re-run the execution without the live transaction host. It always describes the final run of the
session; restarting from the debugger resets it.

:::warning Sensitive data
Replay snapshots may contain private account state, note data, advice inputs, and other transaction
witness material. Treat them as sensitive files and do not share or commit them publicly.
:::

Replay it later, offline, in the `miden-debug` TUI — no node, client, or account state required:

```bash
miden-debug --replay session.mdsnap
```

The recorded events are fed back through the debugger's event-replay host, so you can step through
the same execution, set breakpoints, and inspect the stack and memory exactly as during the live
session. The snapshot carries no source files, so the debugger shows disassembly.
